Landing page for my friend.
One evening when I was walking with my friend, she said that she did not have enough money. As a joke, she said about finding a rich guy.
A rich guy would solve her problems with a lack of finance.
I developed this idea and suggested making a website for her that would help her with search.
We discussed the details and later I started to implement.
By the time the site was ready, she no longer liked this idea (oh, those girls),
therefore photos are taken from open sources.
